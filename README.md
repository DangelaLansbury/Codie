# Codie

A simple interactive tool for translating codons of three nucleotide bases into amino acids.

Designed to complement the classic Codon Wheel infographic tool, Codie is an evolution of [simpleCodon](https://dangelalansbury.github.io/simpleCodon/) (my first coding project) and is inspired in part by this [Codon Wheel](https://pearcetm.github.io/jscodonwheel/) by Dr. Pearce and Dr. Roy.
